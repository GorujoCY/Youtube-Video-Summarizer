# Known issues
- [ ] Contents on the file does not assume it is the actual token (because it doesnt do an api test to check, commited to fix in the next versions)
- [ ] During internal testing, OpenAI's API doesnt work, always being rate limited on my API Key (this is why I want the community to see for themselves and help fix any issues)
